# SEM & CFA Analysis of Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)

## Overview
This repository contains a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) study examining the factor structure and construct validity of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) among university students.

The analysis tests a three-factor model of fatigue consisting of physical, emotional, and social fatigue dimensions using AMOS software.

---

## Objectives
- Assess the construct validity of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)
- Test a theory-driven three-factor CFA model
- Evaluate model fit using standard SEM fit indices
- Examine relationships among latent fatigue dimensions

---

## Dataset
- Source: Sleep Fatigue with FSS dataset (Kaggle)
- Participants: University students
- Measures:
  - 9-item Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)
  - Additional sleep-related variables

---

## Model Structure
The proposed CFA model includes three latent variables:
- **Physical Fatigue**
- **Emotional Fatigue**
- **Social Fatigue**

Latent variables are allowed to correlate.

---

## Key Results
- Good overall model fit (CFI > 0.95, CMIN/DF < 2)
- Significant factor loadings for all observed variableigue dimensions are strongly interrelated

---

## Tools & Software
- AMOS
- SPSS
- Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
